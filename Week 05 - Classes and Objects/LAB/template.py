# ====================================================================== CLASS
# 1. Define a class called Record.
#
#    Threshold : __init__(self, label, value, limit) storing all three as
#                attributes. No methods yet.
#    Typical   : add a method status(self) that returns "OVER LIMIT" (100%+),
#                "WARNING" (90%+) or "OK", worked out from self.value and
#                self.limit. Give it a one-line docstring.
#    Excellent : not in this lane.

# your class goes here

            type(self).over_limit_count += 1
            return "OVER LIMIT"
        elif percent >= 90:

    return records


# ==================================================================== RECORDS
# 2. Create your records.
#
#    Threshold : create at least 2 Record instances directly in the code.
#    Typical   : same, but now print each one's .status() as well.
#    Excellent : not in this lane.

    Record("R-001", 87.0, 100.0),
    Record("R-002", 120.0, 100.0),
    Record("R-003", 45.0, 100.0),
]


# ==================================================================== OUTPUT
# 3. Print a report for each record.
#
#    Threshold : label, value, limit, inside a border.
#    Typical   : add the result of .status().
#    Excellent : not in this lane.
#    Your final line should look like: 1 of 3 records are OVER LIMIT

for record in records:
    print(record.label, record.status())
print(f"{Record.over_limit_count} of {len(records)} records are OVER LIMIT")


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it and check every record's numbers by hand
#    [ ] Check every method only reads/changes its OWN object (self) -
#        nothing reaches outside itself
#    [ ] Check every method and __init__ has a one-line docstring
