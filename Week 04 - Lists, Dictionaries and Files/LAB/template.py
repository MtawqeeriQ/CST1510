RECORD CHECK  -  AI / Data Science lane  (Excellent version)
============================================================

Name  :
Lane  :  AI / Data Science
Date  :

Run it:   python template.py

Loads every dataset record from datasets.txt (label,value,limit - one record
per line), checks each one against its limit, prints a bordered report, then
writes label,status lines to check_results.txt and prints how many records
were over limit.

Excellent pieces:
  - records loaded from your own data file (Typical)
  - results written out to a new file
  - running count of OVER LIMIT, printed once after the loop
  - the load is wrapped in try/except - a missing file starts empty, no crash

# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [x] Run it and check every record's numbers are correct by hand
#    [x] Ran it with a missing file - the try/except caught it and started
#        with an empty list instead of crashing (FileNotFoundError)
#    [x] Every function does one job - status logic lives only in
#        check_record, loading only in load_records, printing only in
#        print_report, file writing only in write_results
